# sorting-algorithm-visualization

This project is a sorting visualization application implemented in C++ using the SFML library. It provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more. Users can interact with the application to see how these algorithms work on randomized input data.

### Implemented Algorithms ðŸ§®
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- Bubblesort
- Minsort
- Swapsort

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools and libraries installed:

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- SFML library <3
- Google Test (for running tests)

### Installation with make

1. Clone the repository:
```js
git clone https://github.com/raphsenn/sorting-algorithm-visualization.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```js
cd sorting-algorithm-visualization
```

3. Edit the Makefile
Before building the project, you'll need to edit the Makefile to specify the correct paths for the SFML library and include directories based on your system. Open the Makefile in a text editor and update the following lines:

Replace "yourpath" with your own path.

```js
CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2
LDFLAGS = -I/your-path-to/sfml/2.6.1/include
LIBS = -L/your-path-to/sfml/2.6.1/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
 ```

4. Compile the project using the provided Makefile:
```js
make all
```

5. Run program
```js
./main
```

### Installation without make

1. Clone the repository:
```js
git clone https://github.com/raphsenn/sorting-algorithm-visualization.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```js
cd sorting-algorithm-visualization
```

3. Compile the project (without Makefile):
```js
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -I/your-path-to/sfml/2.6.1/include -Iinclude -c src/application.cpp -o application.o
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -I/your-path-to/sfml/2.6.1/include -Iinclude -c src/main.cpp -o main.o
```

4. Linking
```js
g++ main.o application.o -o main -L/your-path-to/sfml/2.6.1/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system
```

5. Run program
```js
./main
```

Enjoy exploring the visualization of sorting algorithms!
